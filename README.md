SBSP B2 Engineering Energy

This project is a team based project, with 3 teams of 6. This repository is the "Energy Network" section that is dedicated to the Space Bridge Simulator. The project simulates a spaceship bridge, each team having thier own jobs to do. We, as the "Energy Network", must maintain energy distribution to each energy consumer, whether it's a cannon, thruster's or sheild's.

The Energy Network is a team of 6. We broke up into 3 teams to maintain the networks modules.

There are 3 main modules:
 1. Distribution
 2. Energy
 3. Coolant
 
Each of the modules are conforming to a MVC pattern, so you will find a model,view and controller class for each of the modules. As the project has progessed, there have been more additions to the repository. Each of the modules are being unit tested. As the project contiunes, the repository is sure to expand.

version 2.1
This reposity contains code related to the games development module for the engineering team. 
The entire project is on the master branch, there are no dvelopment branches currently. 
To play run the reactor-test-system scene in unity.

updates:
v2.0 Everything is merged into one scene. Reactor, inventory, storage and consumers.
v2.1 Added 2 ui Sprites to indicate wether it is ok to distribute energy or not. 

Team members are: Juliusz Karski, Tadek Okuniewicz, Ross Nolan, Mehreen Malik, Gelmis Bartulis and Adem Slavotic.
